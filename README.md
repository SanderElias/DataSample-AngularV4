# DataSample

This project is a quick sample to show how you can have multiple selects that update each other. The data is randomly genreated on the fly, and it will create between 10 and 15.000 rows. (because of this, init might take a while!)



This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.0-beta.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
